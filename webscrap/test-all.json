The golden rule is that it doesn't matter which train operator you buy a ticket from, as they'll all sell you a ticket from anywhere to anywhere, for the same price. If you're a visitor from overseas, your best option is probably Trainline (thetrainline.com/) - they charge a booking fee on top of the ticket price, but they'll accept just about any payment card.

Interesting enough, anison itself is a portmanteau of anime (\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1) and song (\u30bd\u30f3\u30b0) which refers to musical tracks used in various anime series and often gets misspelled by adding a \"g\" at the end since bawka gaijins can't into nippongo properly. Anyways, anikura refers to the use of \"anison\" related music in a \"club setting\" hence how the genre gets its name. Honestly, if you still need to hand to be held on what makes something \"anison\" or what is a \"club,\" then you need to GTFO and lurk moar.\n\nOne of the more notable anikura is Akihabara MOGRA (MOGRA for short) which has been associated with this imageboard for well over a decade. However, just limiting yourself to one venue would do yourself a disservice since there are other livehouses and even devoted anison groups who help contribute to anikura all over Japan! However, for those who wish to explore the anikura scene in Japan, otaku-bar.com would be a great place to start your journey.\n\nAlthough the primary source of anikura comes from venues in Japan, there are also held online. As previous mentioned: MOGRA is the most well known anikura which also streams a lot of their events online via Twitch. However, there are individuals associated with MOGRA which also streams online and one of them is the President of MOGRA: D-YAMA who goes by the channel name of choroyama via Twitch. As previously stated, MOGRA can be used as the base on discovering other venues and even DJs who also stream online.\n\nSince online streaming is the play, there are international anikura which primarily stream online and also hold physical events when available. One of the anikura group that can trace their origin to this very imageboard would be Anison Hijack which has been streaming consistently every two weeks on the Twitch platform. Obviously, there are many international anikura online and hopefully you can check them out!\n\nThe following is a sample list of various anikura that stream online via Twitch.\n\nJP clubs:\nmogra\nakibaraizeen\n\nComment too long.

On the real world, Patchouli and Meling have dreams about Ghost Meiling and Patchy's fight, which explodes into apocalyptic proportions by the ending, with Meiling painstankly managing to seal Sekai for some seconds. Meiling and Patchy have a tender moment and, before Patchy can kill Anon, Sekai's plan come to fruition and she speaks to her parents. Within Sekai's world, Meiling and Patchy come to know more of her struggle and promise to get her out of the HSE, with Sekai telling them her plans for the Solstice before, in a heartfelt display, sending them back home. Meiling and Patchy merge with their real selves explosively, but Patchy needs to go to further lengths to keep Meiling alive, taking half of her pain which takes her worn mind into Meiling's mental landscape. There they talk about the past and the future, get to know more of each other and the friendship they built in the HSE and reinforce their promise to Sekai. It's immensely cool~;\n>Rinnosuke is all fine and cool until, one day, literal Susano'o descends on his store for a second and recovers Kusanagi and then gives it to Keine who has started her plan of using a fake blue moon made from Mokou's flames layed on top of the regular moon to trigger her Hakutaku form and so write the futures of Seiga and her kids. Under the confusing influence of the full blue moon, Mokou discovers that this is the only time Keine can write her own future, meaning Keine from the future controls Keine of now during the Blue Moon. She speaks some cryptic things and, wielding Kusanagi, absords the full blue moon then passes out... Well, at least it wasn't as confusing as Goro trying to nuke the HSE. On the other side of the spectrum, Mr. Hieda is preparing to go to war and has contracted Sanae to fight Mokou; he also kills traitors in his clan, a harrowing sight. Duels with an apprentice shrine maiden to show power of humanity and then goes to have a PTSD moment followed by a promise to fucking genocide all Youkai, all while 'talking' to Akyuu in his head. The man has lost his mind...\n>Tsukasa visits Anon, quarrels a little with Ran; watches as Hina has a fucking seizure, and then fucks his brains out, but since she's the Sex Fox\u2122, decides to spike Anon's drink with a fertility pill to, probably, get her pregnant;\n>Goro prevents a kappa ploy against the HSE with good ol' brutality, impresses a white wolf captain and, because one Anon begged, prevents his death through numb and desensitized hermit;\n>Takane moans about the place crumbling now that the boss, Yukari, doesn't give a fuck anymore and is content with letting all go to hell.\n>Mima and Seiga have a hag battle, with Mima getting mogged by the chinese hag even with support from Genji from beyond;\n>Clownpiece hounds Reisen for a little, gets called a little shit and spergs.

Same situation with Hunt and higher ranks too, it's all either cheaters or rats, or both. Got into Tarkov a couple years back, but it turned out the EU region in that game is one giant farm for Chinese RMT cheaters, there also isn't any matchmaking in Tarkov, meaning cheaters play in the same lobbies as shitters and aren't put in high containment ranks.

Like Zelda OoAS and Dragon Quest Monsters 2 were released around that same time frame and had almost none of these issues.\n\nThe reason things happen is also bad and repetitive, senseless battles waged by the most sorry excuse of an evil team plot. The background lore plot idea actually isn't bad and shines in the not Rocket parts, but everything else and almost every non-original Gen 1 character is an unlikeable mess, and the Johto league comes off more as a daycare than a functional Pokemon League.\n\nI hate that I listened to fags calling it peak Pokemon and not to play an enhancement rom hack instead, at least that way I'd get it over with faster.

Aside from the obvious UI tweaks, big ones are nerfing creature level scaling to their normal level, i.e. every goblin warlord will always be only level 20, every nether lich will always be only level 26, and so on. NPC level scaling remains unchanged, both for late-game challenge and because I don't have time to edit thousands of entries. Secondly, I edited the random leveled lists for items, and removed everything above chainmail, steel, and silver, so that the only time these will be seen are when hand-placed specifically. I'm at level 40-something and I've only seen a single set of elven armor in the game, and the only d*edric gear I've seen has dropped from, well, daedra, and not random bandits shaking you down for 10 gold.\nI've completed the KotN questline (kino, better than Tribunal or Bloodmoon), the fighter's guild, the arena, and am finishing the mage's guild before finally beginning the main quest.

The stat growth and skill acquisition mechanics I enjoyed, but battles really grinded the game to a halt. You are limited to a three person party. So inherently you're limited on how many actions you can do a round. It does seem that the developers intend for the player to have a designated defensive character that uses a shield to block in coming attacks for everyone. So now you go from three people that perform actions during battle to just two since you need someone reducing the damage your party receives or they'll end up folding in battle. So now if you encounter five or so enemies you really don't have the fire power to end battles quickly. Then later on when you gain more spells it becomes important to use elemental shields on your party to further reduce incoming damage. The problem is with how magic works in battle. You have to \"contract\" the elemental magic to shift it to your side of the field before you can attempt to cast a spell. So in later battles your first turn is shifting the element to your side, second turn is setting up an elemental shield, then on the third turn you can start acting against your foes. This gets even worse when later on when enemies aren't bound to your rules and can cast an elemental barrier and shift the element to their side of the field within a single action. That would normally take the player two. Now you're playing elemental tug of war to get the element on your side of the field or the spell will fail casting if it isn't on your side of the field.\n\nAll of that creates drawn out battles. If there were more characters in a party and the magic system was trashed then this game would be more entertaining.", "repLink": "thread/3451007/i-just-beat-legend-of-legacy-and-enjoyed-it-at", "repsList": []}, {"id": "t3406860", "usrName": "Anonymous", "subj": "", "postTime": "02/29/24(Thu)16:04:56", "postMess": "What CRPGs are we excited for this year?

The player begins as the faction Titan trying to secure independence from the inner planets. Later the campaign moves to the Frontier system, a system that orbits the star Damarat and was recently discovered. All 9 factions have sent expeditions to this new system in the hopes to establish a foothold and gain access to new planets and resources. After journeying across the fathomless depths of space, the player's expeditionary force has just completed construction of it's first spaceport in orbit of a new world. With the arrival of the other factions, the player is drawn again into ancient conflict between the factions, and must continue the struggle under the light of an alien star.\n\n(i have characters limits in this thread i will post more about the game and videos etc)\n\nthere will be people who are toxic because of my thread because there is to much text for read !i wonder how people will understand the game story and the development of the game etc right?", "repLink": "thread/1719214/falling-frontier-scifi-game-that-nobody-talk", "repsList": []}, {"id": "t1726813", "usrName": "Anonymous", "subj": "", "postTime": "04/11/24(Thu)16:49:16", "postMess": "what are some less known cool rts games?", "repLink": "thread/1726813/what-are-some-less-known-cool-rts-games", "repsList": []}]

Then I started thinking about maybe getting a hybrid for max efficiency, but all the ones I could get seem to be slow and boring to drive.\n\nAnd so I started thinking about an EV again, particularly a Tesla. Looks like I could get a dual motor awd long range model or even the model 3 performance for around 25k or less, which is the upper end of my budget. As much as I wasn't planning on getting one, it might actually make the most sense for me.

The only notable evs around back then were the original tesla roadster which was just an electric lotus, and then later on the electric sls amg. Now after the 2016 election, everyone's made it their identity to hate electronics and to act like the crude and mushy feel of old muscle cars now constitutes a \"visceral and raw sensation\" that can't be felt in anything else.

He clearly doesn't have a good understanding of what sex is (his wife spent years trying to seduce him before he figured out how to mate) and it seems like his paternal instincts might be overridden by the fact that his owner is doing all the care-taking for the new baby (which seems to consist mostly of feeding it vials of what I assume is horse semen). Sure, the owner might swat at Beaker with a stick if she catches him trying to copulate with his daughter, but how long before the confused parrot manages to slip it past the goalie? Or before his lonesome daughter, without knowledge of any other male parrots, mimics her mother's seduction of her father? By interrupting these birds' natural habitat, we've introduced them to frightening ignorance and Oedipal constraints.\n\nAnd while it's easy enough to dismiss these dynamics as merely a part of pet ownership, what's to stop us from interfering with nature even further?

These are everything from the Demodex mites that dwell in hair follicles, to the gut flora that assist with metabolism, nutrition, and resisting pathogens. It could be said that any given human is legion, is multitudes. Microbes are omnipresent in the environment as well, amidst every animal, every inch of soil, every ounce of the oceans.\n\nIn 2014, the microbiologists Jack Gilbert and Josh Neufeld published a thought experiment, in which they imagined what would happen if all the world's microbes were to abruptly vanish: a total apocalypse, yet one with neither decay nor disease, where every corpse remains pristine. This scenario is summarized here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80t\nPR5HH9Zo\n\nHow can the concept of microbes be used in an interesting, relevant way in an RPG context?\n\nFor example, would microbes even exist in a fantasy world? If they do exist, would they be thought of as \"little spirits\" or something similarly animistic? Would there be druids focused on studying and shepherding microbes? Would this be old and established knowledge, or would this be a new breakthrough in understanding the world? Could there be some magical method of purging a person or an area of all microbes (e.g. cleansing, teleportation), perhaps out of some well-intentioned desire to banish disease and uncleanliness? Might there be someone so disgusted by the thought of these myriad creatures crawling around everywhere that they are now concocting a global-scale ritual to rid the world of all \"little spirits\"?\n\nWhat if certain races/species, such as elves and dwarves, are so mystical in physiology that their bodies are actually free of microbes?

Town is actively being besieged as bresiegers are launching incineary projectiles into town and setting it on fire. In this situation, I would like to present the PCs with a few situations, where they may contribute to the town being saved/defended by picking between several choices, given to them by the local leaders.\n\nI have in mind simple things like:\n- Hey, wise adventurers, should we place the militia on the town walls or assign more men to put out the fires?\n- Hey wise adventurers, the town orphanage and granary are on fire. Which one should we save? We can only save one.\n- Hey, wise adventurers. We have a number of badly burnt victims in a local temple - should we distribute potions of healing evenly, or give all of them to those who can man the walls?\n\nDisclaimers: PCs may find solutions of their own to these challenges, but I would like for then to be properly conceptually challenged - not just \"we split the party, one third sets out to put out the orphanage fire, the second third the granary fire, the remaining third of the party will help man the walls\".\nThere will be no \"muahaha, the granary has burnt down, hunger sets in\", but I would like some challenges that challebge party a bit, so the duality might be needed to be written a bit smarter then an average CRPG style \"sell the child or kill the mother\" with a 60 sec timer. Even if PCs find the solutions of their own, I would like to give them the run for their money as much as I can.\n\nAny other ideas on what choices I could present to them?\n\nThanks!", "repLink": "thread/92490986/hey-guys", "repsList": []}, {"id": "t92490365", "usrName": "Anonymous", "subj": "Warhammer 40,000 General - /40kg/", "postTime": "04/15/24(Mon)01:24:00", "postMess": "New Thread Edition\n\n>Green Tides and Dread Mobs\nhttps://www.warhammer-community.com\n/2024/04/08/green-tides-and-dread-m\nobs-new-ork-detachments-go-back-to-\ntheir-roots/\n\n>Community Links:\nhttps://www.warhammer-community.com\n/warhammer-40000-downloads/\n\n>3rd Party Models Pastebin:\nhttps://pastebin.com/Q33bkBUh\n\n>Torrent:\nInfo hash: 7214f3185b4249d3C1889f696ee39218cf0\n92375\n\n>10th Edition Rules:\n\nComment too long.
